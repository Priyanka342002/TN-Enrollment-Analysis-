📊 TN School Enrollments Enhanced 2025 – Data Analysis (Python) & Business Intelligence Project
🔍 Executive Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive performance analytics framework for government schools across Tamil Nadu, covering the period 2016–2025.
The solution integrates structured data transformation, index modeling, and interactive business intelligence reporting to assess institutional performance and identify systemic risks affecting enrollment and retention.
The objective is to analyze:
•	Enrollment trends
•	Dropout rate analysis
•	Infrastructure impact
•	Teacher–Student Ratio performance
•	Socio-economic influence on education
•	School Quality Index (SQI) development
•	District-wise school ranking
This project demonstrates strong skills in Data Analytics, Power BI, Excel, Data Modeling, KPI Development, and Business Intelligence Reporting.
